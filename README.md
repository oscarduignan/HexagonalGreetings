# HexagonalGreetings

Not an actual app - just returns random kanye sayings as a greeting (which is strangely 
gratifying, from kanye.rest)

Just messing around with hexagonal stuff after reading a book about it and playing with Java 
to get a bit more comfortable so I can do adhock changes and contribute to design discussions
more easily in PRs.

Also needed to run through the process of stubbing parts of a spring config in cucumber step 
defs to help people at work.
